          <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
          <article>
            I'm Ezenandu Ifeanyi, studied Chemical Engineering(Federal
            University of Technology Oweeri) & MBA(University of Lagos) with 11
            years working experience as Process Production Engineer in Nigeria
            Energy Sector.
          </article>
          <article>
            I am a strong analytic and a problem solver with experience in
            Chemical/Petroleum Engineering plant control, operations, design and
            Construction. A highly motivated and reliable graduate with
            exceptional work ethic and demonstrated ability to complete a wide
            range of activities requiring clear communication, excellent
            organisational skills and attention to detail. Able to work well in
            teams and under pressure, ensuring the smooth and efficient
            completion of allocated tasks.

            My first engineering experience was through an internship at The
            Shell Petroleum Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), the first
            international oil company (IOC) in Nigeria. After my internship, I
            further gained experience on automated and digital process plants
            with Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited. My role
            in Shell was mostly on oil and gas stabilization and production
            operations. And I worked on well test and lift-gas optimization
            project, and introduced (after benefit-cost analysis) the use of
            deformable elastic material under crude oil sample can caps as one
            of my project recommendation and action plan. This in-turn boosted
            reliability of our well performance data thereby optimizing
            production (higher profit) through an accurate and effective gas
            lifting.

          <article>
            In other to develop myself as a core design engineer to tackle world
            most challenging engineering problems, I joined an EPC company, EPCM
            Engineers LTD, Nigeria. Working as Process/Piping/Project Engineer,
            I Managed Front-End Engineering & Detailed Design of Oil
            Stabilization & Gas gathering Facility, Crude Oil Refinery,
            LNG/CNG/LPG/ Natural Gas processing facility; Installations;
            Procurements; Construction Management; Material Take Off List;
            Pricing; performed troubleshoots on process plants; facilitated
            HAZOP’s, HAZID, SIL Analysis, What-if and Risk Assessment sections
            on oil & gas facilities.

            Seeking possible management competency with opportunity in
            organically building and managing completed project (critically
            needed by Nigeria) operations, I re-joined an E&P company. I am a
            Lead Production Operations Engineer today at Conoil Producing
            Limited – developed Operations SOPs, smart Gas Well Test Evaluation
            Sheet and Well choke Gas/Water coning Analysis; I managed and
            supervised daily production activities.

          <h1>REASON FOR ALTSCHOOL</h1>
          <article id="why">
            In my day to day engineering work activities, we use tools like
            excel for manipulation and storage. This has limitations including
            users blocking macros which automate excel task invariable rendering
            excel for light engineering calculations. Number of colleagues or
            same field experts that can access the information are also limited
            compared to hosting on internet. Due to current demand for data
            handling in my engineering field using Python(targeting frontend for its output) and the need to build things that can
            scale(utilizing web front end, instead of computer stand-alone apps that limits service distribution) brought me into AltSchool to learn Web Development.

            With the knowledge of Web Development - frontend(HTML, CSS &
            JAVASCRIPT) and backend development (PYTHON with DJANGO or FLASK), I
            can now deploy Python language based Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence solution
            models into Web front end. This can be accessible from any location
            on earth; add value to the body of body of knowledge world wide. I
            await an awesome journey!
